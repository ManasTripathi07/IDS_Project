# IDS Project - Team Executioners

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying **Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms** to a dataset to derive meaningful inferences and explore various approaches for effective classification. 

The primary goal is to recognize black-and-white rectangular pixels representing the 26 English capital letters, distorted through 20 fonts. The dataset contains 20,000 unique samples. 

### Key Features:
- Preprocessing and analyzing a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition).
- Implementation of multiple ML classifiers, including:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**
- Selection of the most optimal classifier based on metrics such as **accuracy** and **F-beta scores**.

## Dataset Description

**Source**: [UCI ML Repository - Letter Recognition Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition)

**Specifications**:
- **Features**: 16 attributes representing statistical measures of pixel distributions.
- **Target**: 26 classes representing English alphabet letters.

---

## Steps Undertaken

1. **Dataset Preprocessing**:
   - Converted raw data to CSV format.
   - Applied **One-Hot Encoding** and **Label Encoding** for non-numeric data.
   - Checked for missing/null values and cleaned the data.

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Used **Min-Max Scaling** for uniform scaling.
   - Evaluated and compared with **Standard Scaling**.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Investigated class distributions and relationships between attributes.
   - Used scatter plots and feature importance analysis (e.g., `ExtraTreesClassifier`).

4. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20% split).
   - Maintained consistent class distributions across partitions.
